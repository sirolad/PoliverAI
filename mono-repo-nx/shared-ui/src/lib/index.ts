// React Native shared UI primitives and RN-style token mapper
// This file exports native-friendly components and a minimal mapping of
// the centralized style tokens into React Native style objects. The
// goal is to provide a small surface area (`@poliverai/shared-ui`) that
// screens can import from while porting web code to React Native.
