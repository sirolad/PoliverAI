# 📘 GDPR Compliance Verification Assistant

## 📝 Project Overview

The **GDPR Compliance Verification Assistant** is a GenAI-powered system designed to verify compliance of privacy policies and data processing documents against GDPR regulations. It uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **LLM agents**, and **feature engineering** to:

- Parse uploaded policies
- Match text against GDPR articles
- Provide clause-level compliance verdicts
- Suggest improvements
- Generate audit-ready compliance reports

---

## 🚀 Core Features

- **Upload & Verify Documents** → Upload a privacy policy or data processing agreement.
- **GDPR Knowledge Base** → Retrieve relevant articles/recitals via RAG.
- **Verifier Agent** → Matches policy clauses against GDPR requirements.
- **Critic/Summarizer Agent** → Provides plain-language explanations & recommendations.
- **Compliance Scoring** → Assigns a compliance score with confidence levels.
- **Export Reports** → One-click export to PDF for audits.
- **Query Mode** → Ask GDPR-related questions in natural language.
- **Comparison Mode** → Compare two policies (e.g., draft vs. final).

## 👥 Team Roles

- **Engineer 1** → Data prep & RAG pipeline
- **Engineer 2** → Retrieval & verifier agent logic
- **Engineer 3** → Critic/summarizer agent + recommendations
- **Engineer 4** → Feature engineering (NER, compliance scoring)
- **Engineer 5** → UI/frontend + report export

---

## 📅 Development Plan (1 Week)

- **Day 1** → Setup repo, GDPR dataset, embeddings, baseline retrieval
- **Day 2** → Build verifier agent (match clauses → GDPR)
- **Day 3** → Build critic/summarizer agent + recommendations
- **Day 4** → Add compliance scoring & JSON schema
- **Day 5** → Frontend (upload doc + results)
- **Day 6** → Exportable report + query mode
- **Day 7** → Testing, polishing, final demo prep

## ✅ Deliverables

- Functional GDPR compliance assistant (demo-ready)
- GDPR knowledge base with vector embeddings
- Working RAG pipeline with verifier & critic agents
- Frontend for document upload, compliance checks, and export
- Final presentation + demo video
